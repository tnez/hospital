* PatientDB

  Collection of medical cases, catalogued by symptoms.

** Version 3.0

   After a bit of re-tooling I've decided to change the focus of the
   application from a patient database, to a case database. The idea
   being that future development will allow doctors and patients to be
   able to review cases, as well as do things like view cases related
   by symptoms and other characteristics.

   - cases have many symptoms through a join table
   - notes have been created and can be associated with either a
     patient or a case through a polymorphic assocation (:notable)
   - names and addresses have a polymorphic relationship with
     patients, with the idea that other entities (doctors,
     administrators) may also have names and addresses in the future


** TodoList

   - [X] describe the project in the readme
   - [X] refactor forms for addressable and nameable
   - [X] create a case entry form
   - [ ] a case has states
